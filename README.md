# Table Booking Android App

Table Booking is a Java Android App that illustrates how to design good Human-Machine Interfaces. It involves the full app design and prototyping of an MVP to find restaurants, look at their menu and book a table. This short project was part of the IFT2905 course I took at Université de Montréal in 2021.
